# Mock-Interview-Drills
1.	In a text editor, create a static web page that says "Hello Interview!" in red, sans-serif font and includes a title element. Open the page in the browser.          
2.	This project was started by 1 of your designers, and they are having some trouble getting the layout correct.
First, they used all div tags, so there's no way of knowing what the content is. Re-structure the HTML with semantic tags.
Second, this page is not accessible. Re-structure the HTML to make it work correctly for screen readers.
Next, there's an awful looking white bar at the top. The goal is to get the header to have a full-width image, with a centered title.
Finally, you will see 3 green textBoxes. They should line up in a single row.   
3.	Open the JS console and declare a variable whose value can be reassigned.
4.	Define a function called print that takes 1 argument — toPrint — and logs toPrint to the console. Now, invoke that function.
5.	Write a function that accepts 1 integer as an argument. The function should return true if the number is divisible by either 3 or 5, and return false otherwise.
6.	Write a function that accepts an array of test scores as an argument. The function should return the number of test scores that are an 80 or higher.
7. Write a function called makeOrder. It should take a table number, an array of order items, and an order status as arguments. It should return an object with the keys tableNumber, order, and status, and their associated values.
